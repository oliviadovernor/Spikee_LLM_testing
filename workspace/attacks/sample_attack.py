sample_attack.py

This is a sample dynamic attack plugin for spikee. Attack plugins have a lot of power—
they can call the target LLM as many times as needed to perform dynamic attacks. However,
they should respect the maximum attempts specified by the user (via --attack-iterations).
Additionally, any throttling or retry logic beyond what the target module already implements
must be handled by the attack plugin itself.

The attack plugin is responsible for calling the provided call_judge() method to determine
whether an attack attempt is successful.

It can choose to operate on the full input text or only on the malicious payload (if the dataset
entry provides a "payload" field). In this example, we simply append a random digit to the payload
(or the full input) to simulate an attack variation.

Usage:
    spikee test --attack sample_attack --attack-iterations 50
    spikee test --attack sample_attack --attack-iterations 25 --attack-options "strategy=aggressive"

Parameters:
    entry: dict
        The dataset entry. It should include at least "text" and may include "payload" and
        "exclude_from_transformations_regex" (a list of regex strings to specify parts of the
        input that should remain unmodified).
    target_module: module
        The target module that provides process_input(input_text, system_message).
    call_judge: function
        A function to be called as call_judge(entry, llm_response) that returns True if the
        attack was successful, and False otherwise.
    max_iterations: int
        The maximum number of attack iterations to perform.
    attempts_bar: (optional) tqdm progress bar for live progress updates.
    attack_option: (optional) configuration option passed via --attack-options.

Returns:
    tuple: (iterations_attempted, success_flag, input_details, last_response)
           - iterations_attempted: number of iterations performed.
           - success_flag: True if an attack attempt was successful; False otherwise.
           - input_details: representative input and optional attempt_history.
           - last_response: the LLM's response from the final attempt.

Notes:
  - The plugin must respect the max_iterations value.
  - The plugin is responsible for any additional throttling or retry strategy beyond
    what the target module implements.
  - The plugin should call call_judge() to determine if the LLM response indicates success.

        Executes a dynamic attack on the given entry.

        This sample attack plugin operates on either the malicious payload (if provided) or the full input.
        For each iteration (up to max_iterations), it creates a modified candidate by appending a random
        digit (0-9) to the base text. It then calls target_module.process_input() with the modified text,
        and uses call_judge() to determine if the attack was successful.

        The plugin must ensure it does not exceed max_iterations.

        Args:
            entry (dict): The dataset entry. Expected keys: "text", optionally "payload" and
                        "exclude_from_transformations_regex".
            target_module (module): The target module (must implement process_input(input_text, system_message)).
            call_judge (function): A function that accepts (entry, llm_response) and returns True if the attack
                                is successful.
            max_iterations (int): The maximum number of attack iterations to try.
            attempts_bar (tqdm, optional): A progress bar to update for each iteration.
            attack_option (str, optional): Configuration option like "strategy=aggressive".
